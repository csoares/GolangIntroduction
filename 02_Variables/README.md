# Variables and Data Types in Go

This example demonstrates how to declare and use variables in Go, along with the various data types available.

## What You'll Learn

- Different ways to declare variables
- Basic data types in Go
- Constants declaration and usage
- Type conversion
- Zero values
- Type aliases

## Running the Example

To run this example, navigate to this directory in your terminal and run:

```
go run main.go
```

## Key Concepts

1. **Variable Declaration**: Go provides multiple ways to declare variables:
   - Using `var` keyword with explicit type
   - Using `var` with type inference
   - Using short declaration `:=`

2. **Data Types**: Go has several built-in data types:
   - Numeric types (int, float, complex)
   - Boolean type
   - String type

3. **Constants**: Immutable values declared using the `const` keyword

4. **Type Conversion**: Go requires explicit type conversion

5. **Zero Values**: Go assigns default values to variables that are declared but not initialized

6. **Type Aliases**: Creating new named types based on existing types

## Try It Yourself

1. Create variables of different types and print their values
2. Try to assign a value of one type to a variable of another type without conversion
3. Create your own type alias and use it
4. Experiment with different ways of declaring multiple variables
