# Hello World in Go

This is the first example in our Golang Introduction Course. It demonstrates the basic structure of a Go program.

## What You'll Learn

- The basic structure of a Go program
- How to declare the main package and main function
- How to import packages
- How to print output to the console
- How to run a Go program

## Running the Example

To run this example, navigate to this directory in your terminal and run:

```
go run main.go
```

## Key Concepts

1. **Package Declaration**: Every Go file starts with a package declaration. Executable programs must have a `main` package.

2. **Import Statement**: The `import` keyword is used to include external packages in your program.

3. **Main Function**: The `main()` function is the entry point of an executable Go program.

4. **Formatted Output**: The `fmt` package provides functions for formatted I/O operations.

## Try It Yourself

Try modifying the program to print different messages or use different formatting options from the `fmt` package.
