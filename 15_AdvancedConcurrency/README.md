# Advanced Concurrency Patterns in Go

This section explores sophisticated concurrency patterns in Go, demonstrating real-world scenarios and best practices for handling complex concurrent operations.

## Directory Structure

1. **01_FanInFanOut** - Pattern for distributing work across multiple goroutines and collecting results
2. **02_RateLimiting** - Controlling the rate of operations in concurrent systems
3. **03_ContextCancellation** - Managing goroutine lifecycles and graceful shutdowns
4. **04_Semaphores** - Limiting concurrent access to resources
5. **05_ResourcePool** - Managing a pool of reusable resources

## Key Concepts

### Fan-In/Fan-Out Pattern
- Distributing work across multiple workers (Fan-Out)
- Collecting and combining results (Fan-In)
- Handling dynamic workloads efficiently

### Rate Limiting
- Token bucket algorithm implementation
- Controlling API request rates
- Preventing system overload

### Context Cancellation
- Proper goroutine cleanup
- Timeout handling
- Graceful shutdown patterns

### Semaphores
- Controlling concurrent access
- Resource limiting
- Queue management

### Resource Pool
- Connection pooling
- Worker pool management
- Resource reuse strategies

## Best Practices

1. Always use proper error handling and propagation
2. Implement graceful shutdown mechanisms
3. Avoid goroutine leaks
4. Monitor and control resource usage
5. Use appropriate buffering strategies
6. Implement proper timeout handling

## Real-World Applications

- API rate limiting
- Database connection pooling
- Concurrent data processing
- Service mesh communication
- Load balancing
- Batch processing systems

Each subdirectory contains practical examples and detailed explanations of these patterns.
