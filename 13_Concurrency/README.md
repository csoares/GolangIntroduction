# Concurrency in Go

This section introduces Go's powerful concurrency model using goroutines. Goroutines are lightweight threads managed by the Go runtime that enable concurrent execution.

## Key Concepts

1. **Goroutines**
   - Lightweight threads of execution
   - Started with the `go` keyword
   - Managed by Go's runtime scheduler

2. **Synchronization**
   - Using `sync.WaitGroup` to wait for goroutines
   - Avoiding race conditions
   - Proper goroutine management

## Examples in This Section

1. **Basic Goroutines**
   - Simple goroutine creation
   - Understanding concurrent execution

2. **WaitGroup Example**
   - Synchronizing multiple goroutines
   - Ensuring all goroutines complete

3. **Practical Applications**
   - Concurrent number processing
   - Simulated web scraping

## Best Practices

1. Always ensure goroutines are properly synchronized
2. Be mindful of shared resources and race conditions
3. Don't create more goroutines than necessary
4. Use appropriate synchronization mechanisms

## Running the Examples

```bash
go run main.go
```

Each example is documented with comments explaining the concepts and patterns being demonstrated.
